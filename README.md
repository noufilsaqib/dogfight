# Project

## Project Kick-off
Welcome to the term project. Each week, you'll get new TODOs for the project during lab. They will usually be related to the topic of the week, but may draw on previous week's knowledge. 

The purpose of the project is to give you an open-ended creative challenge through which you'll practice the concepts that we've learned so far. It is specifically designed to challenge your skills and give you the coding reps needed to learn Java properly. There is simply no other way to learn Java than to write many, many lines of it.

Your first TODO is to come up with a concept for your project. The requirements are:
1) You must use [Processing.org](https://processing.org/) for any visual interface, graphics display, or mouse and keyboard interactivity.
2) The concept must be **significantly different** from previous lab content, but you're allowed to base your project off of labs or [Processing.org examples](https://processing.org/examples) if you need inspiration and starter code.
3) You must eventually have some persistent state, i.e., connect to a save file or database of some sort.
4) You must eventually have some asynchronous or concurrent processing, i.e., calls to a server, cloud-based database, or internet API.
5) You must use SOLID design principles (i.e., use abstract classes, interfaces, composition, etc.).
6) Every team member must contribute at least 1000 lines of code.
7) Every team member must contribute roughly equal amounts of code.

Provided below are starter ideas if you need help.

## Project Starter Idea: Build a Game
For this project, you'll be building a game. Here are how you might imagine fulfilling these requirements:
2) If any lab ideas are used, you must make significant improvements in terms of rendering, computer-controlled character behaviour, player interactions, etc.
3) Saving the game state in a local file using JSON.
4) Setting up a leaderboard or other asynchronous datasource.

## Project Start Idea: Build an app
For this project idea, you'll be building something useful to you, say, a transit mapping app.
1) You'll have to display a map and draw lines ontop of it.
3) Saving state locally in JSON would include recent searches, user profile, etc.
4) Pulling data from Google Maps API.

## Or pitch something entirely different
The only way to get good work out of yourself is if you're excited about coding something. I'm open to ideas and am happy to support with sides of the tech that you may not yet have a good grasp on. E.g., if someone wanted to do a robot project, we could figure out a way to make it work within the project constraints.

## TODO 1: Come up with a concept pitch and initial UML Class Diagram
Submit a written concept (~1 paragraph) and a UML class diagram to this GitHub repo. Be prepared to explain it to Paul (and possibly your classmates) in detail next week. It's OK if it's not the final design, but you should have a working idea of how you're planning to code your game. Include any links or references to other materials if it will help your pitch.
